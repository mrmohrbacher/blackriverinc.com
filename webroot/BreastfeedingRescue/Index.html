            <div id="m1-Learn3-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Milk production speeds or slows depending on how full or drained your breasts are. Simply put, drained breasts make milk faster, and full breasts make milk slower. Why do full breasts make milk slower?  The combination of internal pressure from milk build-up and higher levels of FIL (feedback inhibitor of lactation), a protein in your milk, sends a slow-down signal to your breasts. The more pressure and FIL in your breasts, the stronger the signal. The fuller your breasts become, the slower you make milk.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn3-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >The opposite is also true. Milk production speeds when your breasts are drained more fully and more often. That is why a growing baby who needs more milk feeds more often and for longer stretches, taking more of the milk available in your breasts. This causes your breast to make milk faster. At each feeding, on average babies take only about 2/3 of the milk that’s in your breasts, so you can give each breast more than once and baby will continue to get milk. </div>

Consistent feeding times are rare at first and become more common only after about 6 weeks. If your baby is obviously hungry before 2 hours have passed, this is NOT a sign of low milk production. It means your baby is doing a good job of bringing in abundant milk. Closely-spaced feedings are your baby's way of boosting your milk production as needed. At each feeding, babies take on average 2/3 of the milk that's in your breasts, so feel free to give each breast more than once. Unlike a bottle, your breasts are never empty.</div>

              >Breast compression (popularized by pediatrician Jack Newman) teaches a baby who spends a lot of time pausing to actively breastfeed longer. If done at every feeding for a few days, baby should stay active on her own.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When using breast compression, leave your baby on the first breast to “finish” before switching. Baby is finished when she no longer uses the type of suck in which she opens her mouth wide, pauses, and closes her mouth. She may look like she’s just “nibbling.”</div>

            <div id="m1-Learn8-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >1. If sitting up, hold baby with one arm and hold your breast with the opposite hand. If laid-back, hold your breast with a free hand.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text6" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >2. Put your thumb on one side of your breast and your other fingers on the other side, well away from the nipple and the areola, the dark circle around your nipple.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text7" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >3. Watch your baby for the wide jaw movements that tell you she’s is getting milk. Baby gets more milk when she is drinking with an open mouth wide–pause–close mouth type of suck. (Open mouth wide–pause–close mouth is one suck; the pause is not a pause between sucks.)</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text8" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >4. When baby is nibbling or no longer drinking with the open mouth wide–pause–close mouth type of suck, compress the breast firmly but not so hard that it hurts. Try not to change the shape of the breast near baby’s mouth. With the compression, baby should start drinking again with the open mouth wide–pause–close mouth type of suck.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text9" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >5. Don’t stop compressing until baby is no longer drinking milk actively even with the compression, then release the pressure. Baby may stop sucking when the pressure is released but will start again soon as milk starts to flow. If baby does not stop sucking when pressure is released, wait a short time before compressing again.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text10" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >6. Release the pressure to rest your hand and to allow milk to flow to baby again. If baby stops sucking when pressure is released, she will start again when she tastes milk.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text11" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >7. When baby starts sucking again, she may drink (open mouth wide–pause–close mouth). If not, compress again as above.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text12" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >8. Continue on the first side until compression does not cause baby to drink. Allow baby to stay on this side for a while longer, as she may start drinking again on her own. If she no longer drinks, allow her to come off or take her off the breast.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text13" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >9. When breast compression no longer works to keep baby active, break the suction and take her off the breast. Change her diaper or stroke or undress her more, then offer the other breast. Repeat as many times as needed until baby is done.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn8-text14" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Some pauses during breastfeeding are normal. Breast compression is only needed if baby spends much of each nursing session lazing at the breast rather than drinking milk. Breast compression works because it provides baby with positive reinforcement for active suckling. More milk intake promotes more active breastfeeding. </div>

When using laid-back positions (coined by UK researcher Suzanne Colson), lean back far enough so that your baby can rest tummy down on top of you but upright enough so that you can see him easily without straining your neck. Make sure your head, neck, shoulders, arms, and legs are all well supported. Think about how you sit or lie back at home when you watch a movie or a television show. </div>

              >If the strategies in this section aren’t working, you need skilled help to determine which of the following 3 factors may be contributing to the problem: 1) baby is breastfeeding ineffectively, 2) baby has health issues, and/or 3) your milk production needs help. </div>
            <div id="m1-Learn14-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Ineffective breastfeeding can be caused by unusual anatomy in the baby, such as tongue-tie. In a tongue-tied baby, the membrane that connects the baby’s tongue to the floor of his mouth is so short that it restricts tongue movements needed for effective milk removal. Tongue tie is easily corrected by a simple office procedure. A local lactation professional can refer you to people in your area who correct tongue ties. Other unusual oral anatomy, such as an unusual palate (roof of the mouth) or lip tie, can also affect breastfeeding. A baby born very prematurely may need lots of practice time at the breast before she can effectively remove milk. </div>

              >Baby health issues that can affect breastfeeding include neurological issues, respiratory problems, and cardiac defects. In rare cases, a breastfeeding baby may consume plenty of milk but gain weight slowly due to a metabolic disorder or other condition.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn14-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Your milk production is probably not the main issue if you’ve previously breastfed a baby who gained weight normally. But if your baby does not breastfeed effectively, this will eventually reduce your milk supply.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn14-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Milk production tends to be a hardy process. Adoptive mothers who have never been pregnant can produce milk for their babies just by nursing them. But as with every other organ, not all breasts function normally. Your anatomy and hormonal health can affect your ability to make milk. If you think milk supply may be the issue, seek skilled help by going to www.ilca.org, click on Find a Lactation Consultant, and put in your zip code. See also the excellent book The Breastfeeding Mother’s Guide to Making More Milk, by Diana West and Lisa Marasco, which describes the many factors that can affect your milk production.</div>

Pregnancy related factors—such as a mother’s large weight gain or high blood sugar levels from diabetes--can artificially inflate a baby’s birthweight to the 95th percentile.

            <div id="m1-Learn17-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >If you’ve confirmed from your baby’s weight gain that too much milk is the problem, consider bringing your milk production closer to your baby's needs. If you're worried about ending up with too little milk, know that milk production is a hardy process. If you decide later that you hate your new milk level, you can increase it again. The following strategies can help you bring your milk flow to a better place.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn17-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-7"
              >One breast per feeding</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn17-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >An easy way to slow milk production is to limit each feeding to one breast. If baby still seems hungry, you can return to that same breast as many times at that feeding as needed. Switch breasts only at the next feeding time, not during a feeding.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn17-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >If your unused breast feels full before the next feeding, pump to comfort on that side, expressing just enough milk to make you comfortable and no more. Don’t completely drain that breast or it will signal your body to keep making too much milk. Using one breast per feeding along with pumping to comfort allows your milk production to slow gradually without discomfort or health risks. If your baby is already taking one breast per feeding, move on to the next strategy.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn17-text6" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-7">Block feeding</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn17-text7" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Block feeding means using the same breast for specific blocks of time. Start with 3-hour blocks. Baby can feed as often as he likes, but only on the same breast for up to 3 hours. After that 3-hour block ends, offer the other breast for the next 3-hour block of time. Continue this cycle until your milk production is more manageable for you and your baby but no longer than 1 week. Then use the "finish the first breast first" feeding strategy, which means letting baby nurse as long as he likes on the first breast and then offering the second breast, which he may or may not take. If 3-hour blocks aren't long enough to bring your milk flow under control, extend the time blocks to 4 hours, 5 hours, or even longer.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn17-text8" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >To prevent mastitis when using block feeding, either pump to comfort or completely drain your breasts with a pump on the morning of the first day. Once you’ve drained your breasts as completely as possible, put baby immediately to breast. This will begin the first of the 3-hour feeding blocks. As days pass, if either breast becomes very full, use the breast pump again to drain yourself fully in the morning. Most mothers only need to drain their breasts with the pump once or twice.</div>

              >An easy way to confirm an oversupply is to compare your baby’s weight gain to the average of 2 lb (.90 kg) per month during the first 3 months. If baby’s weight gain is double this or more, too much milk is likely the cause and it makes sense to adjust your milk production. If baby's weight gain is average or below, too much milk is probably not the problem. Try laid-back feeding positions. Or give your baby a few weeks of practice to get more comfortable with your milk flow. If the problem continues, ask your baby’s health care provider to rule out health issues.</div>

              >3. To find your sweet spot, start with your thumb on top of the breast and fingers below, both about 1.5 inches (4 cm) from the base of the nipple. Some mothers find it helpful to curl their hand and use just the tips of their fingers and thumb. Several times apply steady pressure into the breast toward the chest wall. If no milk comes, shift finger and thumb either closer to or farther from the nipple and compress again a few times. Repeat, moving finger and thumb until you feel slightly firmer breast tissue and gentle pressure yields milk. After finding your sweet spot, skip the “finding” phase and start with your fingers on this area.</div>

              >5. While applying inward pressure on the breast, compress thumb and finger pads together (pushing in, not pulling out toward the nipple).  Find a good rhythm of press—compress—relax, like a baby’s suckling rhythm.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn63-text14" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >6. Switch breasts every few minutes (5 or 6 times in total at each expression) while rotating finger position around the breast. After expressing, all areas of the breast should feel soft. This process usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes.</div>

If you feel discomfort, review the instructions, and adjust your technique. It is important to find the method that works best for you.

            <div id="m1-Learn61-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >The key to pumping more milk is not stronger suction but more let-downs, or milk releases. The fewer milk releases during pumping, the less milk pumped. With no milk release, you pump only the small amount of milk around your nipples, at most about 1/2 oz (15 mL) total.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn61-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >What is a milk release? It’s when the muscles inside the breast squeeze the milk-making glands and push the milk out. Without it, most milk stays in your breasts. Milk release is caused by the hormone oxytocin. Some mothers feel it as a tingling or see it as leaking milk. Others feel and see nothing. By watching your milk flow during pumping, you'll see your milk releases as an obviously faster milk flow. During breastfeeding, you can hear milk releases when your baby gulps.</div>

            <div id="m1-Learn61-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When your baby breastfeeds, milk release is triggered by his suckling, the feel of his soft skin, his warmth, and your loving thoughts. A milk release can happen even when you're not breastfeeding if your breasts are touched, you hear a baby cry, or when you think about your baby. Feelings of tension, anger, or frustration can block it.</div>

Too-high suction settings can actually pump less milk. That’s because tensing up from discomfort can block your milk flow.

              >Your pump fit affects your pumping comfort and milk flow. Fit is determined by how well your nipples fit into the pump's opening, or "nipple tunnel" (Figure 1). If the nipple tunnel squeezes your nipple, it slows milk flow and you may pump less milk. A too-large or too-small nipple tunnel can also cause discomfort.</div>

              >You have a good fit if during pumping you see some (but not too much) space around your nipples as they move freely in the nipple tunnel (Figure 2). If your nipple rubs along the tunnel’s sides, the tunnel is too small (Figure 3). It can also be too large. Ideally, you want no more than about a quarter inch (6 mm) of the dark circle around your nipple (areola) pulled into the tunnel during pumping. If too much areola is pulled in, this can cause rubbing and pain (Figure 4). You’ll know you need a different size nipple tunnel if you feel discomfort during pumping even when your pump suction is near its lowest setting.</div>

Keep in mind that pumping one breast at a time with a single pump takes twice as long as double pumping. A manual pump, which is usually powered by squeezing the pump’s handle, can get tiring if you use it often. Visit some of the websites that compare pumps and choose those with features important to you. Notice which brands offer size choices, as if only one size is available, you may have major issues with pump fit.</div>

Storage capacity is based on the amount of room in your milk-making glands, not breast size. It varies among mothers and in the same mother from baby to baby. Mothers with a large storage capacity usually pump more milk at a session than mothers with a small storage capacity.</div>

If you’re exclusively breastfeeding and pumping for a missed feeding, a milk yield from both breasts of much more than about 4 ounces (120 mL) may indicate a larger-than-average storage capacity.

By 4 weeks or so, baby is up to his peak feeding volume of about 3 to 4 oz (90–120 mL), which stays about the same until 6 months of age, when babies start solids and the amount of milk they need decreases.

To get the milk they need, many babies respond to this difference by breastfeeding more often when milk production is slower, usually in the afternoon and evening.

              >A mother who is exclusively breastfeeding (baby gets no other liquids or solids and is primarily fed at breast) will usually pump more milk at a session than a mother who gives formula regularly, because more frequent or more complete milk removals increases milk production.

To do this, subtract from 30 ounces (900 mL) the amount of formula your baby receives each day. For example, if you’re giving 15 ounces (450 mL) of formula each day, this is half of 30 ounces (900 mL), so you should expect to pump about half of what an exclusively breastfeeding mother would pump.</div>

              >Every breastfeeding mother has a magic number. This is the number of daily milk removals (breastfeeds plus pumps) needed to keep her milk supply steady. To estimate your magic number, think back to your maternity leave and the number of times each day your baby breastfed. This is probably pretty close to it if your maternity leave was at least 6 weeks long, you breastfed on cue rather than on a fixed schedule, and your exclusively breastfed baby gained weight well. The key to keeping your milk production steady after returning to work is keeping your total number of daily milk removals stable over the long term. To understand this better, you need to know the two main dynamics that affect your long-term milk production.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn19-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-7">Breast fullness</div>

              >What you need to know about this is "drained breasts make milk faster and full breasts make milk slower." The fuller your breasts become, the more  milk production slows.  </div>
            <div id="m1-Learn19-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >The opposite is also true. Milk production speeds when your breasts are drained more fully. At an average breastfeeding, baby takes about 2/3 of the milk and leaves 1/3. To increase your milk supply, your baby feeds more often and longer, taking a larger percentage of the milk. This happens naturally when you’re with your baby and feeding on cue.</div>

Breast storage capacity refers to the maximum volume of milk available in your breasts when they’re at their fullest during the day.

              >Both large-capacity and small-capacity mothers produce plenty of milk. But their babies feed differently to get the milk they need. A mother with a large storage capacity has more room to hold milk, so it takes more milk (and more time) for the pressure in her breasts to build to the point that milk production slows. With more milk available in her breasts, her baby may always be satisfied with one breast. He may gain weight well with fewer feedings per day than the average baby. And he may sleep for longer stretches at night without milk production slowing.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn19-text13" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >The mother will a small storage capacity has less milk available at each feeding, so her baby may want both breasts more often, need more daily feedings to get the same amount of milk, and wake more often at night to feed. If the baby of the small-capacity mother sleeps too long, his mother’s breasts quickly become full and her milk production slows.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn19-text14" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >If after returning to work your milk production decreases, count how many times each 24 hours you’re removing milk from your breasts. Chances are your number of milk removals has dropped below your magic number. Maybe your baby is sleeping longer at night. Maybe you’re breastfeeding less at home or pumping less at work. No matter the cause, you can reverse this trend by increasing your number of milk removals. Staying at your magic number should hold your milk production steady. Boosting your daily milk removals above your magic number should increase your milk production. </div>

              >To thrive, breastfed babies between 1 and 6 months of age need on average about 30 oz (900 mL) of milk per day. If your baby feeds around the clock and you are apart for 8 to 12 hours during your workday, she'll need about 10 to 15 oz (300 to 450 mL) of milk. This is 1/3 of 30 oz for 8 hours and half of 30 oz for 12 hours. If your baby sleeps the entire night, she'll need the full 30 oz during her waking hours. </div>

              >How can making too much milk cause nipple pain? It can happen when baby compresses your nipple to make overwhelming milk flow more manageable. You can rule this in or out by considering your baby’s weight gain. Average weight gain during baby’s first 3-4 months is about 2 lb per month. Babies of mothers with oversupply often gain double that or more. What can you do if that’s the problem? Try laid-back breastfeeding positions, as gravity may give baby more control over milk flow, ending the need to compress the nipple (see picture below). </div>

              >Wherever there’s broken skin, infections can occur. Nipple trauma puts you at greater risk for developing a bacterial or yeast infection on your nipple, as well as mastitis, an inflamed or infected area in your breast. You should consider infection a possibility if breastfeeding suddenly becomes much more painful and your healing slows or stops. Both bacterial and yeast infections can cause severe pain. The pain may become so intense you turn to pumping instead.</div>

              >In addition to intense pain and slowed healing, if your infection is bacterial, you may also see pus or yellow scabs on your nipple. In most cases, nipple pain that lasts for weeks indicates a staph infection. Sometimes prescribed Bactroban ointment can relieve it. Another effective treatment is a course of oral antibiotics, nearly all of which are compatible with breastfeeding. Oral cloxacillin or erythromycin (for those allergic to penicillin) taken in 500-mg doses every 6 hours for 10 days resolves nipple bacterial infection in nearly 80% of mothers. In some unusual cases, long-term antibiotic treatment may be necessary.</div>

Your nipples may or may not be itchy. The pain may be worse after feeding or at night. If your baby also has a yeast infection, it may appear as white patches inside his mouth (thrush) or as a diaper rash. Yeast can cause nipple pain even if no thrush is seen in baby’s mouth. If you have a yeast infection of the nipple, both you and your baby need to be treated with antifungals. See your health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.</div>

It is only temporary. At first it may be difficult for your small-mouthed baby to latch deeply to your very large nipples, but this is usually outgrown within a few weeks. In the meantime, establish full milk production--about 25 to 30 oz (750 to 900 mL) per day--with an effective breast pump and feed your baby your milk. Pump at least 8 times each day until you get there, ideally within the first 2 weeks. Try breastfeeding every week or two until your baby outgrows your size issues.</div>

              >Inverted nipples can also cause nipple pain. An inverted nipple looks inside out, even when stimulated. It's an innie rather than an outie. Most babies can breastfeed well from inverted nipples, but if your nipples have not spent much time pulled out, after early nursing the newly exposed skin may look raw. Your pain will likely decrease over time. If the pain is severe, try breast pumping. If pumping feels more comfortable, part- or full-time pumping for a while may ease your transition to breastfeeding.</div>

              >If you suspect your baby is tongue-tied, take a look at his tongue when his mouth is open. As he tries to stick it out, its tip may indent in the middle, forming a heart shape. Or he may be unable to raise the back, middle, or the front of his tongue to the roof of his mouth.</div>

              >The most effective treatment for tongue-tie is to release baby’s frenulum by clipping it. That sounds worse than it is, because there are few nerves and blood vessels in the frenulum, and the procedure is usually done quickly in a doctor’s office with little or no need for anesthesia. After this procedure, your baby should be able to nurse immediately. You will likely notice a decrease in pain while breastfeeding, either right away or over time. Health professionals who clip tongue ties include oral surgeons, dentists, pediatricians, family-practice doctors, and ear, nose, and throat specialists. Ask local breastfeeding specialists who performs this procedure in your area. If an obviously tongue-tied baby can breastfeed effectively and comfortably, there is no need to clip it.</div>

              >As with any skin trauma, wash your damaged nipples with soap and water at least daily in the shower to help prevent infection. Be gentle. Rubbing expressed milk into the area has not been found to help. Nor has keeping traumatized nipples dry. Wounds heal faster when kept slightly (but not too) moist. The following products provide a moist-wound-healing environment that reduces pain and speeds healing. But they will not solve your problem if you continue breastfeeding with a shallow latch. There’s no benefit to using these products together, so pick one.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn24-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-7"
              >Ultrapurified lanolin</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn24-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >This product is available at most drug and grocery stores. The brands safest for baby do not need to be washed off before the next feeding. For best results, apply enough lanolin after every feeding to keep your nipples moist until baby breastfeeds again. If clothing friction bothers you, apply lanolin and wear hard plastic breast shells (available in most baby stores) in your bra between feedings to protect your nipples. When using breast shells, be sure your bra cup is large enough to hold them in place without leaving red rings on your breasts when removed.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn24-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-7">Hydrogel pads</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn24-text6" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >These soothing gel pads are available at most baby and drug stores. You wear them in your bra like a breast pad between feedings. They've been found to reduce nipple pain more than ultrapurified lanolin. Brand names include Ameda ComfortGels, Soothies by Lansinoh, and Medela Tender Care. Wear them in your bra between feedings. For even greater comfort, chill a spare pair in the refrigerator first. They can be reused until they turn cloudy, then should be discarded. Care instructions vary by brand. Those with longer wear times are more cost effective.</div>

Behind these ridges is a smooth area, your hard palate. Closer to your throat, the roof of your mouth turns soft. The comfort zone is near the area in your baby’s mouth, where her palate turns soft.</div>

              >With a shallow latch, your baby’s tongue compresses your nipple against her hard palate, causing nipple distortion and pain.

              >If you breastfeed sitting up or lying on your side, make sure baby’s body is pressed against yours (no gaps) and bring her chin into contact with your breast, either with a light, soft touch or a tapping movement. This contact between breast and chin should trigger a wide-open mouth. Once she opens wide, apply gentle pressure from behind her shoulders as she latches to gently push the breast deeper into her mouth. It may also help her reach the comfort zone if she approaches the breast off-center, as this allows the nipple to extend deeper than when it is centered. To do this, align baby with the breast so that her lower jaw is farther from the nipple than her upper jaw (see the picture below).</div>

              >When you have mastitis, breastfeed at least every 2 hours during the day and every 3 hours at night, starting with the sore breast. If the baby won’t feed that often, pump. Breast inflammation causes milk flow to slow. You'll probably notice lower milk production in your sore breast. (Your breasts make more milk than baby needs, so baby will still get plenty.) Position baby for breastfeeding with her nose or chin pointing toward the sore area. Make sure baby has a deep latch to help the milk drain more fully.</div>

Frequent breastfeeding or pumping will clear the mastitis more quickly and help boost your milk production back to where it was before the mastitis developed. You may see thickened milk or crystals in pumped milk. This is safe to feed the baby.</div>

            <div id="m1-Learn33-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >As UK researcher Suzanne Colson (who coined the term "laid-back breastfeeding") discovered, leaning back to breastfeed can short-circuit many breastfeeding battles. Gravity keeps you and your baby in full frontal contact without effort. Gravity also works in harmony with your baby’s reflexes to help him get on the breast deeply, which helps him settle quickly.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn33-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When using or semi-reclined, or laid-back, feeding positions, lean back far enough so that your baby’s body rests comfortably tummy down on top of you but upright enough so that you can see him easily without straining your neck. While leaning back, make sure your head, neck, shoulders, arms, and legs are all well supported. Think about how you sit or lie back at home when you watch a movie or a television show.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn33-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >In semi-reclined positions, gravity helps your baby’s reflexes in the way nature intended. Experiment to find the positions that work best for you. Think of you and your baby as two puzzle pieces. Use the following simple adjustments until you find your own best fit:</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn33-text5" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >1. Adjust how far you’re leaning back until you find a good angle for you. Some mothers prefer their head and shoulders higher or lower.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn33-text6" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >2. Adjust the direction your baby lies on your body. Put baby lengthwise, diagonally, or across your torso until you find a position that works.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn33-text7" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >These two dynamics will help you find your own best variations. If you’ve had a cesarean, know that your baby doesn’t have to rest on your incision. The pictures below show some of the many laid-back options.</div>

            <div id="m1-Learn33-text8" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >In any position, make sure your baby’s feet are touching you or something soft nearby. Foot contact triggers some of baby’s feeding reflexes and, if missing, can cause latching struggles.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn33-text9" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Although your baby can get to the breast without help in these positions, feel free to help him in any way that feels right to you. If his nose seems blocked after latching, you can make an airway for him by pressing on the breast with your fingers.</div>

            <div id="m1-Learn32-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When you sit up to breastfeed, gravity pulls baby down and away from you. Baby knows how to latch when her entire front—face, torso, arms, legs, feet—are touching you. But any gaps between you can disorient and frustrate her. In these positions, gravity can turn the same reflexes that are supposed to help your baby get to the breast into major hurdles to feeding. Rather than moving her toward the breast, her arms flail and legs kick. Head-bobbing may propel her away from your breast. Baby wants to latch, but it's not easy when fighting gravity.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn32-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >From your perspective, after giving birth vaginally, sitting up straight puts pressure on a very tender area. Also, to keep baby pressed against you at breast height, you must either find a feeding pillow that’s just the right thickness or hold her in your arms for long stretches, which can be tiring. Because gravity makes it harder for baby to take an active a role in latching, you must do most of the  latching work yourself. And with gravity working against you, it may feel as though there are just too many moving parts to manage.</div>

2. Lie on your side, facing your baby, with a pillow under your head.
3. Put the other pillow behind your back.
4. Lay your baby completely on his side facing you, and align his body with yours so he is nose to nipple.
5. Pull his feet in close to you so your bodies form a V, which may be narrow or wide, depending on your breast size (see Figure 1).</div>

7. Put your upper hand behind your baby’s shoulders and pull him gently toward you, brushing or tapping his chin lightly against the breast until he opens wide.
8. Quickly move him onto the breast from behind his shoulders to get a deep latch.
9. Press his shoulders tightly against you as he latches on.
10. Wedge the rolled-up towel or baby blanket behind his back to keep him in place, leaving his head free to angle back.</div>

              >Breast storage capacity is measured by the amount of milk available in your breasts when they’re at their fullest during the day. When your breasts become full, the milk exerts pressure that signals your body to slow production. With a small storage capacity, this happens sooner and it takes less milk before production slows. With a large storage capacity, it takes longer and takes more milk. The fuller your breasts become, the stronger the signal to make milk slower. </div>
            <div id="m1-Learn50-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"

            <div id="m1-Learn50-text7" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >If after 1 month, your baby usually takes both breasts at feedings, feeds longer than about 20 minutes total, more than 7 times per day, and more than twice at night, your storage capacity is probably small or average. Breastfed babies of both large- and small-capacity mothers receive plenty of milk. But because the amount of milk available per feeding varies so much, their daily feeding patterns differ.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn50-text8" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When it comes to night feedings, if you have a large storage capacity, you have the room in your milk-making glands to store much more milk before it exerts the amount of pressure needed to slow milk production. If you have a small storage capacity, after a shorter sleep stretch, your breasts become full enough to slow  your milk production.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn50-text9" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >With an average or small storage capacity, night feedings may need to continue long term for your milk production to stay stable. Also, because your baby has access to less milk at each feeding, night feedings may be crucial for her to get enough milk overall. What’s important to a baby is not the milk she gets at each feeding, but how much she gets in a 24-hour day. If you nurse whenever baby shows feeding cues, she will naturally get the right amount of milk. But if a mother with a small storage capacity forces her baby to go for longer stretches between feedings, this may slow her milk production and her baby’s weight gain.</div>

If a large percentage of your baby’s milk intake is pumped milk, consider your choices more carefully.

              >When you get sick, you are most contagious just before your symptoms develop. By the time you know you’re ill, your baby has already been exposed to your illness. At your first exposure to an illness, your body makes antibodies to fight it and adds them to your milk to protect your baby. Most breastfeeding babies either don't get sick at all or get a mild case. If you stop breastfeeding, you take away the only protection to your illness your baby has.</div>

              >Regarding medications, the vast majority of over-the-counter and prescribed drugs are considered compatible with breastfeeding. This means the health risks of feeding formula are considered greater than the risk of continuing to breastfeed with a tiny amount of that drug in your milk.

            <div id="m1-Learn65-text2" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Some mothers wean before they feel ready because others convince them they are being “selfish” or harming their child by breastfeeding past a certain age. But what our culture considers normal is at the very early end of the broader human experience. Knowing this can give you more freedom to make your own decisions rather than being swayed by others.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn65-text3" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When human cultures are viewed as a whole, the average age of weaning is between 2 and 4 years, with some societies breastfeeding for as long as 5 to 7 years. History tells us that breastfeeding for years was common practice in most times and places, including in the colonial United States. Interestingly, most religions’ holy books address the age of weaning. The Koran recommends breastfeeding for at least 2 years, the Torah 3 years, and Hindu Ayurvedic texts 2 to 3 years. Does this mean you should breastfeed this long? Not necessarily. But if you decide to breastfeed longer than most people you know, you can rest assured that this is not harmful to either you or your child.</div>

              >In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated its policy statement on breastfeeding. In it, it stressed the importance of breastfeeding for at least 1 year. Why? Because the health of mother and child are measurably worse when breastfeeding ends earlier.</div>

            <div id="m1-Learn64-text4" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >When your baby weans before 1 year, this puts her at greater risk of colds, ear infections, diarrhea, meningitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. And the health effects of breastfeeding extend far beyond babyhood. Weaning before age 1 also increases her risk later in life of becoming obese and developing asthma, allergies, diabetes, celiac disease, childhood cancers, leukemia, and inflammatory bowel diseases.</div>
            <div id="m1-Learn64-text8" class="m1-text m1-shadow-1 m1-font-3"
              >Even into a child’s second and third year, scientists have found that weaned children are more likely to become ill than children who are still breastfeeding. The living antibodies in mother’s milk work their magic for as long as your child nurses. </div>

              >Despite what you may have heard, breastfeeding is not a drain on a mother’s health and energy. Science tells us that while a mother breastfeeds, she sleeps longer and deeper and her metabolism is more efficient than after weaning. The longer and more exclusively you breastfeed and the more months total you breastfeed during your lifetime, the better for your health. Even decades after your baby weans, cutting breastfeeding short increases your risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, the number-one killer of women.</div>
