<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>- Hawai’i Feb 22, 2001 : Down
Kilueau by Bicycle -</h3>
<IMG SRC="personal_images/Volcano-PaPeter.jpg" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=534 BORDER=0>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Went to Volcano National Park yesterday.
Stopped off at Punalu'u, home of the black (like ace'o'spades black) sand beach
and giant green sea turtles. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Got to ride my bike around Kilueau volcano
yesterday with son Peter. Son Ben and Wife Nancy wandered around the park while
Peter and I took the crater rim road (~12 miles) ride . That took us about 2
hours because we stopped to rubberneck. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>When we finished, Peter and I were so pumped
that we petitioned Mdm. Pele's local representative to let us ride our bikes
down the volcano to Pahala on Hwy 11.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>She said, no. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We demonstrated superior intellect by
appealing to coolness factor of being able to cruise 20 miles down a nearly
continuous grade on bicycles from 4500 ft elevation to somewhere around 1000ft.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>She said, no.</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We tried employing emotional blackmail with
sad, whiny faces, but oxygen depravation and prospect of awesome ride had us
giggling like hyenas on Nitrous Oxide.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>She said, no.</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>We whined and bitched for another 20 minutes.</span>
</p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>She said, to either get in the car or ride
back to Kailua-Kona on our own.</span> </p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>So, we did the manly thing and took off down
the road and told her to meet us at Pahala. When we got to the Hwy 11 the road
sign said that&nbsp; Kailua was 96 miles *that* way, and Hilo 28 miles that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other</i> way. The road to Hilo was all
downhill. We debated briefly, and agreed she probably wouldn't leave us
stranded, because she would have to explain to Mother-in-Law Pat how she left
her husband and middle son stranded in the Kau desert of Hawai'i with nothing
to their names but two bicycles, 2 bottles of water, light clothing, and wallet
full of credit cards. The latter does not come in particularly useful if you do
not happen top near any credit card validating machinery. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Peter and I cruised SSW down Hwy 11, debating
if we would see wife and mother at Pahala, or maybe Punalu'u down the road. Our
map wasn't very good, so I was guessing that we would find Pahala around mile
marker 49. For you “haole” (whitey), you should know&nbsp; that the &quot;Big
Island&quot; is actually sparsely populated, and that a town can consist of a
MacNut outlet, a coffee mill, and what was once a general store in 1940, before
the Nisei were relocated to the camps. The other problem with Hawaiian maps, is
that towns are occasionally covered in lava, and cease to exist as anything
other than a field of&nbsp; a'a (crumbly) or pahoehoe (slick, crusty) basalt.
Think parking lot after being worked over by backhoes or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>really</i> big, vicious gophers with steel teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Mile marker 49 came and went with no sign of
Pahala. Road ahead looked like it proceeded to the vertical in the wrong
direction. This turned out to be an optical illusion, as we cruised over the
crest of a small hill and through a perfumed forest for two miles. At Pahala,
circa mile marker 51, we were not greeted with lei's as is the island custom,
but we did have a very quiet ride back to Kailua down around the southern
point, and back up through the Ka'u and South Kona districts. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>From Hale Kai O'Kona, 9by9</span> </p>
