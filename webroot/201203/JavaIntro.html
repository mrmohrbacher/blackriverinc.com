<BODY>
<H2>Java, Son of Algol</H2>
<P><I>So, </I>you want to see if I can really code in Java...</P>
<P>To demonstrate that I can indeed command yet one more son of Algol (father of Algol-68, C, C++, Perl, et al) to do my will, I have created this little
demonstration for you, a version of the game of Othello.</P>
<P>Originally, I wrote Othello in 1997. The first version took me a little over eight hours spread over three evenings.
Since then, I have constructed a version which is web-capable, allowing multiple players to play each other over the net. I have also taught programming in Java at the <I>Science and Arts Academy</I> in Des Plaines, Illinois to middle and high schoolers.</P>
<P>I choose Othello, because the rules of the game are very compact, as you will see below.
<H2>Rules of Othello</H2>
<P>Othello is game for two players, BLACK and WHITE.
<UL>
<LI>The board is 10 squares on a side.
<LI>The initial setup is for BLACK and WHITE to place 2 counters each in the center of the board, forming a compact square of one row BLACK-WHITE, and the next row WHITE-BLACK.
<LI>Starting with BLACK, each player takes turns placing a counter on the board within the squares.
<LI>Each counter placed must bracket the opponents counters either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
<LI>The opponent's bracketed counters are flipped to the player's color and the turn passes to the other opponent.
<LI>A player must make a play if he can, otherwise he will pass.
<LI>The game continues until all of the squares are occupied or neither player can place a counter.
<LI>The winner has the most squares occupied by his color counters.
</UL>
<P>From these simple rules develops a game of subtle strategy and intense intellectual focus.
<H2>Playing Mike Mohrbacher's Othello</H2>
<P>Follow this link <A HREF="http://c208696-a.mntp1.il.home.com/Othello/Othello.html">(Play Othello!)</A> The class archive is about 50KB in size at last count. If asked, enter username <PRE><STRONG>guest</STRONG></PRE> with no password.
<P>Othello will start as a Java applet in the current frame of your browser.
<UL>
<LI>The game panel is already set for play.
<LI>The cursor will change to a cross-hair over a legitimate play.
<LI>Left-click the mouse to place your counter.
<LI>In single-console mode, you need to turn the mouse over to your opponent.
<LI>A text panel below the game shows the current player, and both scores.
<LI>During play two buttons, <B>Pass</B> and <B>Quit</B> appear to the right of the game panel. <B>Pass</B> will not function if there is a valid play on the board.
</UL>
<P>If the game server is running and available, the <B>Join</B> button will be visible on the right. Press this to either initiate a game, or join an existing game looking for an opponent.
<H2>Technical Stuff</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Othello applet and GameServer were developed using Symantec Cafe and later VisualCafe. The applet GUI is implemented using Java 1.1 AWT.
The HTML for this page and the rest of the site were coded using Allaire HomeSite 2.5b.
The c208696-a.mntp1.il.home.com site is powered by O'Reilly WebSite 2.0 running on a 450Mhz AMD K6 under Windows NT 4.0 sp 5. This site is connected to the net over an AT&T cable modem running easily a 128KB uplink, so if the Java load takes some time, it ain't me, babe.</FONT>
