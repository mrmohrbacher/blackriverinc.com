<H1>Does Intuit Snoop on You?</H1>
<P>I recently upgraded my Quicken software to Quicken 99 Deluxe. 

<P>I did this because I have just upgraded my home Internet connection from a dial-up account to the new-fangled @Home cable modem
service offered by TCI. The old Quicken required a dial-out via modem to download my banking information. Quicken 99 allows me to
use the faster cable modem to fetch my banking records. So far, wunderbar. 

<P>As part of configuring Quicken's Internet connection, there is an option called: "Background Downloading: Enable for shorter faster
Internet sessions." Faster is better, right? 

<P>As you have probably surmised, I am a propeller head. My family is full of propeller-heads. My friends are propeller-heads. Breakfast
conversations with my brother visiting over the holidays are about the merits of tube vs. transistor guitar amplifiers. I am a computer
programmer by profession. I have been in the computer business so long, it was called "Data Processing" when I started. (Then it was
"Information Processing", then "Information Systems, then "Information Technology", but that's another story.) 

<P>Now for the ugly, technical parts: 

<P>Being a good propeller-head, I often run a network monitor, or "sniffer" on my new Internet connection to see who is talking to whom. I
see my friends coming into my little web-site
<I>(S-h-h-h, @Home doesn't want me to run my own webserver!)</I>.
I see the @Home network support staff in Denver pinging my computer.
I see the local @Home router requesting IP-to-hardware address
translations.
I see my computer at 00:29  initiate a TCP/IP conversation with Internet address "206.154.102.89". I went to bed by 11:30
last night. 

<P>I become curious, "who is Internet address 206.154.102.89".
There is a web-site that can help me answer this question:
<A HREF="http://www.arin.net">www.arin.net</A>,
ARIN is the American Registery for Internet Numbers. ARIN tells me this:

<P>I also look deeper into the sniffer's log files. I see data being sent back up to this 206.154.102.89. I see what looks like a hostname in the
front of one of <A HREF="INTUITSNOOP/TCPDATA.txt">data blocks</A>:

<P>Farther on in that same data block I see what appears to be demographic data sent from my computer to QW.quicken.com.

<P>I find this irritating. I surmise that this is a function of the Quicken Download Manager, which keeps popping up in my taskbar. 

<P>From the Quicken Help system: 

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Courier New">
    The Quicken Download Manager is a separate program that you can set to run whenever your computer is on,
    even when Quicken itself is not running. The Quicken Download Manager can tell if you have a connection to
    the Internet open, and use that connection to download updates to the Quicken program.

<P>Apparently, this is not all its doing. 

<P>After a little more digging, I find that to disable the Quicken Download Manager, I need to disable "Background Downloading" to keep the
Quicken Download Manager from waking up. 

<P>I have know for some time that Quicken seems to download more than I ask for. It now appears that they upload more than I knew about.
Has 1984 has arrived just 18 years late? Is Big Brother not the fascist State, but www.american-corp.com? Am I being paranoid?
(Remember, even paranoids have real enemies.) 

<P>Well, that's my story. It's all true, but I don't know what it means. If that isn't a metaphor for the "Information Age", then I don't know what
is.
