    <h1>
        XML - Documents, Schemas, and Namespaces
    </h1>
    <p>
        This article is for XML Schema and Document riggers. Schemas define the structure
        of Documents by creating a nested hierarchy of named Elements and Attributes. The
        purpose of Namespaces is to allow us to
        tie the multiple Schema structures together without getting into a big, knotty ball
        of colliding Names.</p>
    <p>
        We are going to start by taking a quick swipe at the XML basics to establish our
        baseline of knowledge, work our way into Documents, burrow right through Schemas,
        and hopefully have enough energy left to tie all of the bits together with Namespaces
        before we <i>plotz.</i> I am starting at this basic level because so much confusing
        <em>grot</em> has been written about XML, that I feel it necessary to clean off the kitchen counters before we get cooking.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>
            Tagged Text
        </h2>
        <p>
            A text file with XML-compliant markup tags has&nbsp;a remarkable property: it can
            be transformed automatically from a linear stream of characters into an useful,
            abstract object known as a Document.
        </p>
        <p>
            XML-compliant&nbsp;"tags" embedded in the text stream look like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            &lt;tag&gt;</blockquote>
        <p>
            or this</p>
        <blockquote>
            &lt;/tag&gt;
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            or this</p>
        <blockquote>
            &lt;tag attribue="value"&gt;
        </blockquote>
        <h3>
            Tags</h3>
        <p>
            The two sets of bits between '<b>&lt;</b>' and '<b>&gt;</b>' characters are known
            respectively as the start-tag and the end-tag. The pairing of the two characters
            is often called the <i>angle-brackets</i>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Start-tags</h4>
        <p class="indent">
            The start-tag has a simple structure:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            &lt;element-name {attribute-name="attribute-value"}* &gt;
        </blockquote>
        <p class="indent">
            An element-name followed by zero or more&nbsp;<b>attribute-name="attribute-value"</b>
            pairs must appear in between the angle-brackets. (For the purposes of diagramming
            examples, the <em>"{", "}", and</em><em> "*"</em> mean that the enclosed things
            may be repeated 0 or more times.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Element-names and the attribute-names are made of numbers and letters. Names are
            not allowed to have any embedded spaces, and the funny character set is limited
            to the underscore "_", the hyphen "-", the period ".", and under a limited set of
            circumstances, the colon ":". The first character of a tag-name must be a letter
            or an underscore. The colon is only used to separate a Namespace-prefix (more on
            those later) from the rest.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Attribute-values may contain just about anything. I suggest using the form of enclosing
            the values in quotes ("") to avoid any confusion should the attribute-value contain
            any embedded spaces.
        </p>
        <h4>
            End-tags</h4>
        <p class="indent">
            The end-tag has an even simpler structure: the "/" character followed by the element-name
            appears between the angle-brackets appears . In XML, end-tags are required.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            &lt;/element-name&gt;
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <h3>
        Element
    </h3>
    <p>
        The start-tag, the content, and the end-tag together as a set define an Element.
        Notice that I did not say that the start-tag-content-end-tag set <i>are</i> an Element.
        Some processor must exist to consume the start-tag-content-end-tag sets (Element
        definitions) and to create Elements.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Content
    </h3>
    <p>
        The content between a start-tag and it's matching end-tag can be anything (almost),
        including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>nothing - Empty Content, </li>
        <li>arbitrary (almost) text - Simple Content, or</li>
        <li>more strings of &nbsp;XML-compliant marked text - Complex Content. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Empty Content
    </h4>
    <p class="indent">
        A start-tag-end-tag set with no characters in between creates an Element with empty
        content. There is a cheat in the "empty" content model. If the content is empty,
        the start-tag and end-tag can be combined into an empty-content-tag, which looks
        like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        &lt;element-name {attribute-name="attribute-value"}* /&gt;
    </blockquote>
    <p class="indent">
        Notice the forward-slash "/" character right before the closing angle-bracket.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Simple Content
    </h4>
    <p class="indent">
        Simple content is the case where content portion consists of text characters with
        no embedded markup tags. The case of "almost" arbitrary text runs up against the
        problem of escaping the characters used as part of the XML markup tags themselves,
        especially the opening angle-bracket "&lt;". The solution to the problem is to use
        a trick called an "entity". An entity looks like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
        &amp;code;
    </blockquote>
    <p class="indent">
        where <em>code</em> is either a three-digit string of hex-characters, or one&nbsp;of
        the signifiers that will be rendered as their proper glyph. A commonly
        used entity is the <b>&amp;lt;</b> which how we get the "<strong>&lt;</strong>"; character rendered.
        The entity trick is how we were able to represent samples of XML code in this article, the text of which is itself an XML-compliant text file.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Complex Content
    </h4>
    <p class="indent">
        The third, complex-content case, is where things get interesting. I could have a
        nested collection of start-tag-content-end-tag sets.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        &lt;element1&gt;
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;element2 attribute="value"&gt;Some Text&lt;/element2&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;element3/&gt;

        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &lt;/element1&gt;
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Computer-science types (like me) get a really warm feeling when we see recursive
        structures like this, and we cannot <i>wait</i> to tell everybody about it.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Structure of an XML-Compliant Text file.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Hang on, we're almost at the rest stop.
    </p>
    <p>
        An XML-compliant text file has one, and only one, "Root-Element" definition. The
        Root-Element contains an ordered, nested collection of Element-definitions (start-tag-content-end-tag
        sets). Take the figure shown above and put an XML processing-instruction tag in
        front:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &lt;element1&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;element2 attribute="value"&gt;Some Text&lt;/element2&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;element3/&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;element4&gt;<i>Some-more-complex-content</i>&lt;/element4&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &lt;/element1&gt;
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <i>Now</i>, we've got an XML-compliant text file. Because this file has a precisely
        restricted structure, and because that structure can be mathematically defined,
        we can feed it to an XML processor to create a Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        An XML processor is a very common thing these days. Internet Explorer, Mozilla and
        every current web-browser happily consume XML and render it in some basic fashion.
        This article was structured according to the rules of an XML-ified version of HTML
        called XHTML (where the <i>X</i> is for eXtreme HTML!). The other biggest XML processor
        sitting under our noses is MS-Word, which has allowed HTML as one of its native
        formats since Office 98.
    </p>
    <!-- -------------------------- Documents ------------------------------ -->
    <h2>
        Documents
    </h2>
    <p>
        Once XML-compliant text is consumed by an XML processor, it becomes a Computer Science
        thing known as a Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Documents actually have two parts:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style: circle">
        <li>The Instance part is created from the XML-compliant file. </li>
        <li>The Schema part is the set of rules for structuring a Document of a given type.
            More on this later. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Document Object Model (DOM)
    </h3>
    <p>
        The DOM refers to the mechanism for inspecting and manipulating a Document through
        a set of COM interfaces supplied by the Microsoft XML library (MSXML v4). It concerns
        itself with the Instance part of a Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the DOM, a Document is a tree, an ordered list of connected nodes with one special
        node, called the "root", as its entryway. Each node of the tree is an Element, an
        Attribute of an Element, and the Content of an Element. The Content of an Element
        can be a empty, a Collection of other Elements, some text, or a mixture of both.
        The order of the Elements, Attributes, and Content is preserved from their order
        in the original text file.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a Document to be managed by the DOM, the Document's text file must be loaded.
        Only "well-formed" (XML-compliant) can be parsed and loaded into the DOM. During
        the loading of a text file, the DOM verifies its "parsibility". There is no such
        thing as a partly-loaded Document.
    </p>
    <h4>
        ACTIS 5 and the DOM
    </h4>
    <p class="indent">
        The ACTIS 5 Collection class, the COM component that serves up the <code>IMap</code>
        family of interfaces, rests on the DOM. This class is one of the most fundamental
        of the ACTIS framework. Lack of XML Compliance means Collection does not work means
        ACTIS 5 does not work.
    </p>
    <!-- ---------------------------- Schemas --------------------------------------------- -->
    <h2>
        Schemas
    </h2>
    <p>
        A Schema is a set of rules for restricting the structure and content of a Document.
        There are various mechanisms for defining those rules; we use XML Schema.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Schema definition is written as one or more XML-compliant text files to produce
        a SchemaDocument - that's right, Schemas are Documents, too! One SchemaDocument,
        the outermost, may include or import other SchemaDocuments.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        &lt;schema ...&gt;
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;include schemaLocation="GenericTypes.xsd"/&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;include schemaLocation="wActisTypes.xsd"/&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;import schemaLocation="DasApi.xsd" namespace="urn:wActis/DAS"
            /&gt;
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>
        Schema Object Model (SOM)
    </h3>
    <p>
        The SOM refers to the mechanism for inspecting and manipulating Schemas. Schemas
        are defined by the creation and composition of SchemaDocuments. When one of us writes
        an XSD file, we are attempting to define all or part of Schema with a SchemaDocument.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since a SchemaDocument is itself a Document, it is also subject to the requirements
        of being "well-formed" and valid according to its Schema, which is defined by the
        Namespace "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema". But beyond that even, a SchemaDocument
        must be legitmate expression of the SOM, which means that references to names must
        be resolved within the SchemaDocument or to names contained within included and
        imported SchemaDocuments.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we perform the operation: "Parsing and Validating Schema", we are doing two
        things:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Verify that the SchemaDocument is "good" XML. </li>
        <li>Validating the SchemaDocument against the SOM. This means generally that all of
            the references can be resolved. </li>
    </ol>
    <!-- -------------------------- Namespaces ------------------------------------------- -->
    <h2>
        Namespaces
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Names
    </h3>
    <p>
        For an Element, Attribute, or Type to be referenced it must have a Name. The converse
        is not true: it is possible to have Elements, Attributes, and Types that are anonymous
        - they have no Names.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any Name created in a Schema by an Element declaration or a Type definition must
        be unique. No two classes of things in the realm of a Document can have the same
        name. That does not mean that in an Instance you cannot use the same Element twice,
        you just cannot load any set of Schema that have colliding Names. Since a SchemaDocument
        creates and references names, a Schema defined from multiple SchemaDocuments must
        also not have any ambiquous references.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need a way to separate similar Names from different Schema used in a Document
        from colliding; that way is corral Names into Namespaces.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Namespace &lt;=&gt; URI &lt;= Set of Names
    </h3>
    <p>
        A Namespace is a set of names. A Namespace is identified by a Universal Resource
        Identifier (URI), a kind of a name. A namespace URI can simple, or it can look like
        a Universal Resource Locator (URL), a web address.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        urn:wActis
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The only concern of XML is that the Namespace URI be unique within the realm of
        processes interested in all Schemas referencing and defining that Namespace. Just
        because an URI looks like an URL, there is no requirement that it can be resolved
        to the location of anything.
    </p>
    <h3>
        QNames - Qualified Names
    </h3>
    <p>
        Names are classified as either qualified (QNames), or are non-qualified. QNames
        have two parts: the Namespace part and the local name part.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        {namespace}:local_name
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A QName is used like person's proper name; it is used to disambiquite him from all
        other people with the same personal name. (<i>We have two people named "Mike" in our
            office. During staff meetings, our manager needs to use our QNames when referring
            to each of us separately.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are writing XML-compliant text to defined Documents, every reference to
        a QName has to resolve to this two-part form. More on how this will be done in just
        a bit.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Non-Qualified Names
    </h3>
    <p>
        Non-qualified names belong to no Namespace, but they still must be unique.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Defining the Target Namespace of a Schema
    </h3>
    <p>
        Each Schema defines at most one Namespace, the Target Namespace. This is accomplished
        by using the <em>targetNamespace</em> attribute in the <em>schema</em> element of
        the SchemaDocument.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        &lt;schema targetNamespace="urn:wActis" ...&gt;
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        There is no notion of defining a TargetNamespace in an Instance. It's a Schema thing.
        From the viewpoint of an Instance, a Schema introduces a Namespace into the Instance,
        but that uses a different mechanism (Sorry, again, for the forward reference, but
        see below under <a href="#XMLNS">xmlns</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Each schemaLocation attribute contains a set of Namespace-SchemaDocument pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
        QNames have two parts: the Namespace part and the local name part. The Namespace
        part is either explicitly referenced with a namespace-prefix, or it is implicitly
        referenced, by being in the default Namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Namespace part is either explicitly referenced with a namespace-prefix, or it
        is implicitly referenced, by being in the default Namespace.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Included Schema Documents and the TargetNamespace
    </h3>
    <p>
        The major restriction on included SchemaDocuments is that they must not contradict
        the TargetNamespace declaration of the enclosing SchemaDocument. Either the included
        SchemaDocument's TargetNamespace declaration must specify the same TargetNamespace,
        or there must be no TargetNamespace declaration. In the latter case, the QNames
        of the Elements, Attributes, and Types declared in the included SchemaDocument will
        be bound by the enclosing SchemaDocument's TargetNamespace.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
            Configuration.xsd</p>

    <p>
        In the second example, the names declared in the <code>Configuration.xsd</code>
        and <code>GenericTypes.xsd</code> will be bound by the Namespace <em>urn:wActis/DAS</em>.

    <h3>
        xmlns
    </h3>
    <p>
        The primary purpose of the <em>xmlns</em> attribute is to introduce a Namespace
        into a Document. This introduction takes effect starting at the the Element containing
        it and includes all of that Element's descendents. This is why we normally see it
        appearing in the root-element of an Document, but it could appear within any node
        of the Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>xmlns</em> attribute is never defined in any Schema. It's "just there" as
        part of any XML-Schema compliant Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without a Namespace, any names and references to names are unqualified; they appear
        in no Namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
        This could obnoxious pretty quickly given that a Namespace is actually an URI. URI's
        tend to be long and they are often filled with funny characters. Attempts to use
        URIs as part of an element definition in XML-compliant text runs into the "no funny
        characters" rule in the creation of element-names in tags. So esides introducing
        a Namepsace into a Document, the <em>xmlns</em> attribute has two other uses:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>to declare a default Namespace for use in a Document </li>
        <li>to assign a prefix to a Namespace, and </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
        Default Namespace
    </h4>
    <p class="indent">
        The Default Namespace that is in effect at any Element allows us to use QNames -
        proper names - by their familiar, local name. In the absence of an explicit Namespace
        in a reference of a QName, the Default Namepsace will be applied, and if it works,
        the Element's Name is resolved, and all are content.

        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
            IntellX.xsd
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &lt;xsd:schema

        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;xsd:element name="CONFIG"&gt;
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 3pt; text-decoration: underline;">
            IntellX.xml</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0pt;">
            &lt;CONFIG xmlns="urn:wActis" ...&gt;
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In the example shown above, we are allowed to use the element-name <code>CONFIG</code>
        without any Namespace prefix because the Default Namespace <em>urn:wActis</em> will
        be supplied by the DOM when <em>IntellX.xml</em> is loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the <em>xmlns</em> attribute is used to associate a Namespace with a prefix,
        it allows us to reference Here is a common example of the use of the <em>xmlns</em>
        attribute to introduce the XML Schema Namespace into a Document, and also to assign
        the prefix <em>xsd</em> to that Namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Namespace prefixes are used to reference QNames in a Namespace other than the current
        default Namespace. The prefixes become necessary because if you look back at the
        rules for forming Element and Attribute names in a tag, you will see that very few
        funny characters are allowed, and <i>no embedded spaces!</i>. So trying to use Namespace
        URI to qualify a name is right out.

        One of the foundations of the wActis framework is the use of XML formatted files,
        files which can be mechanically verified against pre-defined schemas. Some time
        ago, we noticed that our XML files were no longer being correctly validated against
        our schema definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, I found no less than five flaws, including outright bugs, in the MSXML
        engine (version 4), which did not help us in the least.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the SchemaDocument part of a <i>schemaLocation</i> attribute cannot be resolved
            to an actual file, the DOM validation silently fails. It then fell back on the behavior
            of only validating a Document for <i>well-formed-ness</i> </li>
        <li>Circular or diamond-shaped schema-document dependencies cause schema validation
            against the SOM to fail with a false claim of duplicate element declarations or
            type definitions. </li>
        <li>Versions of the MSXML prior to SP2 could not correctly resolve type definitions
            imported from other namespaces. </li>
        <li>There is no path mechanism for resolving schema-document references in MSXML, forcing
            all schema-documents to be resolved using only relative paths. </li>
        <li>If a document referred to a schema-document that was not well-formed, or did not
            validate against the SOM, an attempt to parse the document failed with the infamous
            <b>"<i>ROOT-ELEMENT</i> not defined"</b> </li>
    </ol>
