   <title>My Early Career</title>
</head>
<body>
   <p>
      My name is Mike Mohrbacher and I have been a professional computer programmer since
      1976. My first job was with the Data Processing Deptartment of Winnebago County,
      Illinois. I was hired by the department head, a Mr Jim Smiley, on the strength of
      my taking two classes in FORTRAN, and pulling an "A" in my Calculus I class at Lake
      County Community College. The "DP" department managed the tax rolls and collections
      using an NCR Century 100. Data storage was a combination of 9-track tapes and removable
      "cake cover" disc packs. The tapes played a roll in the near early termination of
      my career in data processing.
   </p>
   <p>
      I wrote code in COBOL and NEAT-3 - the assembler language. Source code was entered
      on coding sheets, and then submitted to the key-punch group for entry onto 80-column
      cards. The key-punch ladies generally refused to waste time running a verification
      input, so source decks came back with errors in addition to ones I had created myself.
      After a short time, I learned to type in my source code myself on the IBM 029 key-punch
      machines. The 029 was a mechanical device requiring a forceful finger stroke to
      punch a character. For years after, when I had moved onto shops using such fancy
      devices as "on-line" terminals and later IBM PC's, my co-workers would comment on
      the terrific pounding I gave to keyboards. I liked the original PC keyboard, because
      it was built on a solid metal plate, giving it a good "bottom" to the keystroke
      feel.
   </p>
   <p>
      Any way, the NCR Century was a "batch" system, so the design of almost every data
      update program was the same: a transaction file was passed against an original master
      file to produce a new master file. Some of the newer systems were designed to use
      new disc packs, but the volume of the data of the tax system required that the master
      files be kept on 9-track tapes.
   </p>
   <p>
      The day-shift operator, "Roger" did not care for programmers wasting his valuable
      machine time requesting compilation and test runs. If a new programming required
      testing, I was expected to work into the 2nd shift, or if it was tax collection
      season and busy, even to come during the midnight shift, to do my testing and debugging.
      After several months, I was entrusted with writing some changes to one of the tax
      programs. After rounds and rounds of data entry, debugging source coding (and data
      entry) errors, I was ready to test. I came in one midnight to test my new code.
      I located the appropriate tapes containing a transaction file and a copy of the
      original matching master file in the tape storage locker.
   </p>
   <p>
      All I needed was an empty tape to hold the new, updated master. I did not find any
      scratch tapes in the tape rack, but I found a short reel of tape laying on top of
      one of the tape drives. I noticed that this particular reel still had its data protection
      ring, a flexible plastic ring which fit into a groove around the hub of tape. The
      presence of this ring was was sensed by tape drive, and disabled the "tape write"
      function of the device. I peeled the ring out of its groove, expertly spooling it
      onto the drive, closed the door, hit LOAD, and was rewarded with the *FLOOP* *WHIR*
      *SPLOOSH* of the vacuum tensioning mechanism of the drive. Then, wanting to have
      a clean tape to work with, I stepped over to the operator console, and loaded the
      "T(APE) INIT" deck to match the device number on the plug of the tape drive I had
      just mounted. A new volume header was written onto the front of the tape, followed
      by nine feet of "tape marks", magnetic punctuation marks. I ran my tests and verified
      the correctness of my code by around 2AM and went home.</p>
   <p>
      The next morning, I arrived at work by 7:30AM (working 3rd shift was no excuse for
      coming in late the next day). People were shouting, waving arms, and running around
      with looks of consternation. I stopped at Jim's desk and inquired on the source
      of the hub-bub. He told me that some idiot has erased one of the tax master files.
      My activities earlier that morning came to mind, and I asked if the damaged file
      had happened to be on a short reel laying around the operations room. He said, yes
      it was, and wanted to know what I knew about it. I admitted that he could stop looking
      for the idiot, and told him of my work. After turning several shades darker in color,
      he ground out through his teeth that it was a good thing for me that I had come
      clean, because if I had not, my career as a computer programmer would have come
      to an abnormal ending. As every computer programmer should know, an ABEND is never
      a good thing.
