<p>I program computers for a living. It&#39;s my craft. I like doing it, and I believe that I have gotten 
    rather good at it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of blogs and code-sharing sites out on the internet. I use them (<i>a lot</i>) to research (<i>steal</i>) solutions 
    to problems in my work. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and 
    <a href="http://codeproject.com/">Code Project</a> come to mind. Great sites, I couldn&#39;t live without them. (<i>Well, I could live without them, but I might not make a good living without them.</i>)</p>

<p>This online journal (<i>blog : the ugliest word ever put into general circulation by the digirati. I just flat-out refuse to use it...anymore...circular reference alert...dang!.</i>) is not one of those sites. This journal is about being inside the head of a computer programmer and 
    what it takes for me to produce solutions to my clients&#39; problems. This journal is my decision to take the constant, yammering, internal monologue and put it somewhere other than the inside of my head in the hope it will stop spinning, go away, and leave me in peace. Then I can spend more time appreciating the great things happening on the outside, like May breezes in Chicago after another gawdawful winter. Like my adorable grandchildren (<i>yours, not as much for me</i>). A glass of vino rosso with my wife and friends on the piazza in Orvieto. Pretty women in summer frocks. Cold beer...you know...real life. Maybe you find something here of value. That would be nice.
</p>
<p>The seed for this journal is from an article I read a long, long time ago about a man named Donald Knuth. You may be familiar with Professor Knuth from his page-turning doctoral thesis : <i><a href=http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/2441/1/Knuth_de_1963.pdf>Finite Semifields amd Projective Planes</a></i> (<i>okay I stole that from his Wikipedia article</i>.) No? Well, if you are a computer programmer, you had better be familiar with his published work: <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1 through 4</i>. (<i>Or should at least admit to having seen a copy of Volume 1 somewhere in your education.</i>) The point is, this guy is one of the computer programming gods, 
    like Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Grace Hopper, and Edgar Frank &quot;Ted&quot; Codd. (<i>Not forgetting to mention the patron saint of programmers: Ada, Countess of Lovelace.</i>)</p>
<p>The story that is told around the campfires is that Professor Knuth meant to write seven volumes on the art of computer programming, but somewhere in the 1980&#39;s he became interested in the problem of automated typesetting, and decided to divert his energies for a couple of weeks to write a computer-driven typesetting language, which became known as T(E)X. It took him longer than he expected, which is perhaps why there are only four volumes to TAOCP, rather than the original seven. </p>
<p>Anyway, Professor Knuth kept a journal of his programming efforts while he was developing T(E)X, and several lines were published in the article I was reading. The line that caught my eye was something like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, 'Nimbus Mono L', monospace;font-size: 12px;">Friday : Finally realized why system is crashing. Expected array to be defined as 1-based, when it was actually 0-based.</p>
<p>And this astounded me. Donald &quot;He-Freakin&#39;-Actually-Wrote-The-Book-On-Computer-Programming&quot; Knuth had a &quot;one-off&quot; error in his code. There were similar entries in his journal. He fixed that bug. Wrote more code. Fixed more bugs. T(E)X was released and was used to typeset his books. I concluded: maybe I can create good code also, even if I&#39;m not Donald Knuth. </p>
<p>And here&#39;s the point: astounding pieces of software craftmanship don&#39;t arise cleanly from human minds like a liquid T-1000 Terminator (<i>the second one, where Arnold played a good Terminator</i>) off a linoleum floor. They are patched together from previous drifts of thought. They are product of the unique, personal history of our minds. They are not the result of proper application of a &quot;correct&quot; methodology.
    This is a fantasy held by many in our field, and they are wrong. Mind you, I have nothing against being methodical, but method is not methodology. Craftmanship is the application of methods in a reasonably efficient order. Methodology is a cargo-cult belief that there is only one, correct ordering of methods that is applicable to all times, all budgets, all goals, and can be applied by all minds.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not giving up on my craft. If you can keep me occupied for eight hours a day making something useful to you or your business, I will be quite satisifed (<i>as long as I get paid</i>). If you need me to follow along with your corporate development standards and not whine about it at work, I can do that.&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, it&#39;s just one more constraint in the process. It could be kind of fun.</p>
<p>But just remember, it&#39;s people&#39;s minds that produce this software gumbo that you need. And it&#39;s how our minds go about that process that interests me in this journal. Maybe you as well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>See you later.</p>
