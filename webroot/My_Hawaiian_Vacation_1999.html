      </h1>
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
      Did you know that the Hawaiian alphabet has only 12 letters; every syllable 
      ends in vowel and the ' mark means a unvoiced glottal stop (like the - in 
      oh-oh!)? Yeah, so what anyway! I'm back from across the ocean. Before I left I 
      was a neurotic depressive. Now, I'm a neurotic, depressive with a tan...and 
      less hair. I shaved off my beard and got my annual haircut.
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         We stayed on the west (leeward) side of the island in the Kona district, just 
         south of the town of Kailua-Kona in a condo on Ali'i (A-LEE&lt;&gt;EE) Drive 
         right on the shore. On the windward side of the island it rains... a lot. On 
         the leeward side it never rains. The joke is that the weather map for the Kona 
         coast is painted on the wall of the television station: low 65- high 85 slight 
         chance of showers up-slope. It's correct 360 out of 365 days of the year.

         I snorkeled in the lagoons a couple of time with my kids. Rented a bike. Walked 
         across the caldera of a volcano. Read 3 1/2 science fiction novels. Ate a lot 
         of fish, mostly ahi (tuna), some mackerel and mahi'mahi. But no 
         humuhumunukanukaapua'a (it's the state fish) The only sushi I had was tuna fish 
         salad maki from a vendor at the airport in Honolulu (ho-NO-loo-loo). Frankly, 
         the food is better in Chicago than in Hawai'i.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         Yes, guys, the beaches are populated with wahini in skimpy beachwear...who are 
         all old enough to get the senior citizens discount at Denny's. Snorkeling in 
         clear tropical waters is way big fun. A soon as you put your mask in the water, 
         you are in the middle of aquarium, except the Yellow Tang are 4X larger and 
         they are swimming all around you, along with Puffer Fish, Parrot Fish, Trigger 
         Fish, etc. mostly snacking on the coral at the bottom of the lagoon.When Ben 
         saw this for the first time he made a quick 180 for the shore, but came back to 
         hang onto me as we circled around in the water. The water was cool, but not 
         cold. Mister Benjamin &quot;0% Body-Fat&quot; Mohrbacher only lasted about 15 
         minutes before I could feel him shivering against me like a telegraph key and 
         we had to come back in for good. Peter and I did several circuits around the 
         lagoon and saw many shamelessly gaudy fish. He discovered that the layer of 
         water over your back is NOT a sun-screen.

         Riding a bicycle will definitely either get you shape or kill you. It was a 
         sixty minute ride up to the intersection of King Kamehameha III Drive and the 
         beltway (alt. 500 ft) from the condo (alt. 5 ft.), and about about a five 
         minute ride down.

      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         The island of Hawai'i is basically two big shield volcanoes, Mauna Loa, and 
         Mauna Kea. We took a peek through the 25 cent binoculars at a resort in the 
         middle of a volcanic coastal desert in the South Kohala district and could see 
         the snow on the peak of Mauna Kea (alt. 13,795 ft)
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         Pele, the fiery goddess of lava lives inside the volcanoes, and occasionally 
         rearranges the furniture. When she does this, one of the Mauna will spit up 
         another million cubic yards of 2000 degree molten basalt through a vent, 
         burying whatever is in its path to the sea. The lava cools into either A'A - 
         crumbly looking lava,or PA'HOEHOE - smooth looking lava depending upon the 
         amount of dissolved gases and original temperature, and voila!, more land! Will 
         Rogers was wrong, they are making more of it. A'A flows look like a badly 
         managed construction sight, where they tore the ground up and then forgot to do 
         anything else. PA'HOEHOE looks like a dragon took a dump over several square 
         miles. This pretty much covers the geology of the Hawai'i.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         My brother-in-law took myself, and the boys, Peter and Ben, for a hike across 
         the Kilauea caldera from the edge of the Halema'uma'u caldera (which is a 
         &quot;little&quot; crater only about a 1 mile across and 200 ft deep) for a 2 
         mile hike over terrain that could be used for a great battling-aliens-in-space 
         movie, except the workman's comp payments for torn ankle ligaments, shattered 
         knees and broken legs would drive you into bankruptcy. It was all PA'HOEHOE 
         with man deep cracks in it and steaming vents stinking of sulphur - more than a 
         little like Hell's parking lot. The &quot;trail&quot; consisted of 4&quot; dots 
         painted onto the rock every 50 yards and sacred rock cairns. The sacred rock 
         cairns were about 3 ft high and made out of broken pieces of PA'HOEHOE, so 
         their visibility factor was not high. The climb out of the Kilauea caldera is 
         up a 200 ft slope made of pumice. The 30 minute hike took us a little under 2 
         hours. Nancy was supposed to meet us at the trail head with the car. I think 
         she was not pleased when 90 minutes had passed and 2/3 of her offspring were 
         last seen walking into a smoking volcano. She started orbiting the rim of the 
         crater, checking for our presence at the other trail heads. Which means when we 
         emerged at the end of &quot;Desolation Trail&quot;, she was nowhere in sight. 
         Eventually she made it back to our site while we sat remarking on the 
         interesting way the light, misting rain was being driven sideways across the 
         landscape at 20 mph. After a few remarks were exchanged regarding the original 
         time estimates vs. the actual time past, we drove off down slope.

      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         All of the &quot;big island&quot; has a resident population of around 140,000 
         spread over maybe a several dozen towns. The biggest town is Hilo on the east 
         (windward) side. We did a circumlocution of Hawai'i (the island, not the state) 
         by car (although there are several INTERstate highways on the island of Oahu.). 
         Its was about 2 1/2 hours counter-clockwise from Kona to Volcano National Park. 
         Another 2 1/2 hours from the park around the north-east and back around into 
         Kona. And that's the BIG island. By the look of the housing, most permanent 
         residents are lower working class types living in corrugated sheet metal and 
         concrete block houses. But a lot of them have great views down slope to the 
         sea, or into some lush, tropical valley (on the windward side).
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         We made a side-trip to Oahu. My choice was to go to the USS Arizona memorial. 
         It's the favorite stop for Japanese tourists in the whole state. Over a 
         thousand BOYS died in less than nine minutes when an Japanese armor-piercing 
         bomb exploded in the forward magazine. (Movies always show MEN as soldiers. On 
         the way home in San Francisco, a platoon of GI's were in the airport lounge 
         waiting for our flight. I don't think they looked old enough to drive, let 
         alone handle guns!)

      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         Nancy and Ben got to notch off another state capital (Honolulu), the first that 
         was not a neo-classical columns and rotunda affair. The Hawi'ian capitol 
         building holds both houses of the legislature and the executive on four floors. 
         There is a central courtyard open to the sky, designed so that if the people 
         had something to say enmasse, they were certain to be heard.

      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         Peter began his quest to play in every Ultrazone in the country by doing rounds 
         in Waikiki and Pearl City.

      <p style="font-size:11pt;">
         Want to own a house in paradise? Upslope, maybe 120K$-180K$, depending on the 
         view (see earlier description of housing stock). On the beach side of Ali'i 
         Drive your looking at 300K$ for a three-bedroom, two-bath condo. The condo we 
         stayed at was 4-bedroom, 3 full bath, one bedroom was a master suite, witha 
         lanai (that's Hawai'ian for a nice balcony) and one parking spot would probably 
         go for a cool 1/2 a mil. Location, location, location! You can probably get a 
         nice studio condo on the upslope side of Ali'i for only 200K$. Actually. 
         development is not a sure fire thing. We saw several Hot!Hot!Hot! housing and 
         shopping mall sites that consisted of graded lava. Since they were generally 
         A'A, it was hard to tell a failed housing development from a normal lava flow.

         I hoped to have some snaps, but I discovered that the back of the camera had 
         popped open somewhere climbing out of Kilauea, so we will see what images 
         survived, if any. Check my website in a couple of weeks and see if I figure out 
         how to get some good color scans onto the pages.

         Anyway, A-lo-ha (hello, good-bye, whatever) from Chicago.
