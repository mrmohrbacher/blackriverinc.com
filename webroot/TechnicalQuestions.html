         Preface
      </h1>
      <p>
         The key issue facing you, as a technical manager, or as a team leader, is 
         having good-quality people at hand. There are several dimensions to 
         people-quality: initiative, reliability, honesty, ability to play well with 
         others, hygiene, etc., all of which are very important, but when looking for an 
         engineer or technician to add to your staff, there is the very critical 
         "K-T-S." factor to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
         The K-T-S factor is harder to quantify than it might seem. One approach taken 
         by many organizations is to apply a standardized test to applicants, such 
         BrainBench. Another approach is to look for certifications. The one most 
         commonly used by headhunters is to apply a first-order sieve to the stack of 
         resumes - the "bingo card" method (if your resume contains all of the same 
         buzzwords as the job requisition: "BINGO!, <em>You</em> may be a winner!)
      </p>
      <p>
         Each of these approaches has their utility, and each has its problems. A 
         standardized test actually tests for the ability to take standardized tests as 
         much as it tests for mastery of subject matter. A long list of certifications 
         leaves you wondering when the applicant had time to do his job in between 
         taking all of those certification tests.
